== About Me

I am an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Memphis. The overarching theme of my research is the analysis, design, and control of complex and autonomous systems, including autonomous ground and aerial vehicles, multi-agent systems, large-scale cyber-physical networks, and robots that interact with humans.

I apply tools and techniques from *control theory*, *optimization*, *graph theory*, and *machine learning* to control and assure the safety of these systems. My work bridges theoretical foundations with practical applications in robotics, smart grids, and human-robot collaboration.

== Research Interests

- *Control Systems*: Fault-tolerant control, event-triggered control, consensus control
- *Robotics & Automation*: Human-robot collaboration, probabilistic movement primitives
- *Multi-Agent Systems*: Distributed control, cooperative robotics, UAV/UGV coordination  
- *Cyber-Physical Security*: Smart grid security, attack detection and mitigation
- *Medical Robotics*: Active ankle-foot orthosis, assistive technologies

== Recent Highlights

~~~
*Latest Publications* (2022-2024)
- "Heterogeneity-aware graph partitioning for distributed deployment of multiagent systems," /IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics/, 2022
- "Real-time plant leaf counting using deep object detection networks," /Sensors/, 2020
